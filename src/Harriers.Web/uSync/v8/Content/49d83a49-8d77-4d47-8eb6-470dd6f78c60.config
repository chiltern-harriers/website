Details of the session are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We meet every Tuesday throughout the year at Chiltern Hills Academy, on Chartridge Lane, Chesham to start training at 1930. However, you are advised to check our website for alternative meeting places and times for special events. Changing and showering facilities are available&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Tuesday evening session is largely focussed on endurance. We enjoy a varied programme of road and off road training sessions. Training sessions are mainly off-road trail runs through May to September, returning to the well illuminated road circuits in and around Chesham during the winter months&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Although there are no specific qualifying standards we would expect people new to running to be able to run at least 3 miles continuously, so having completed a 5km parkrun in 30 minutes would be a good starting point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The faster runners in the group are completing up to 8 miles, while the slower runners are usually completing over 5 miles over the course of a session, which lasts about 70 minutes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are welcome to just come along to our main Training Session on Tuesday night at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chiltern Hills Academy, Chartridge Lane, Chesham HP5 2RG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Try out a couple of sessions, and then decide if you would like to continue and join the club. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"},{"key":"6c6ed010-b7db-4d61-b0e2-42096c7acd5e","name":"Rich Text","ncContentTypeAlias":"richTextContent","text":"&lt;h3&gt;Thursday Evening&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in doing more speed work, there is an additional training session for seniors on a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thursday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; evening:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We meet every Thursday throughout the year in Amersham to start training at 1930. During the winter months (October – April) we meet at Rickmansworth Road carpark; May – September we meet at the Pavilion in Hervines Park&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Thursday evening session is largely focussed on developing speed, with sessions consisting of reps of between (approx) 400m and 2km, either on grass or road circuits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The session is specifically focussed at those who have run 10k in 41 mins (men) or 45 mins (women), or who are targeting those times&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The session normally lasts about 45 – 60 mins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday Runs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Including Pub Runs and Trailblazers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The club organises cross-country runs on the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; – 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Sundays of the month, with a trial currently being held on the infrequent 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Sunday&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The runs on the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Sundays of the month start at 0930 from Hervines Park, Amersham and the car park to the Moor Gym and Swim, Chesham respectively. Check the website for details a few days before&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The runs on the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Sundays start at various venues generally within a 10 mile radius of Amersham/Chesham. See website for timings and venues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All runs are off road and circular routes of varying lengths, but generally between 7 and 10 miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maps are provided to allow runners to run at a pace to suit them. Some basic map reading skills are therefore valuable. These are intended to be social runs to suit a range of abilities. While ever effort will be made to ensure no one is left isolated, members are responsible for their own wellbeing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;General Points:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runners are expected to take responsibility for their own health and safety, wearing appropriate clothing (including high-vis in the winter and appropriate footwear for the terrain) and carrying any drinks or snacks which they may require&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anyone training with the club as part of any of its sessions must join as a member and pay the appropriate membership fee. Club subs not only pay for training costs, but cover athlete insurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Club kit is supplied through Hawkins Sport, and runners can purchase Club vests, t-shirts, crop tops, hoodies, waterproof jackets and high-vis vests, as they wish&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://chilternharriers.weebly.com/juniors.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Club can provide assistance to help people to improve their ability to run, to prepare for events and to set personal targets to aim for. We will always welcome runners that have competed at a higher level that are wishing to get back into competitive running and can provide opportunity to compete for the Club in road, track and cross country races. In order to compete for the Club, you need to be an affiliated member of England Athletics. The Club will process your registration with EA, for which you pay an annual subscription fee, determined by EA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;"}]</Value>
