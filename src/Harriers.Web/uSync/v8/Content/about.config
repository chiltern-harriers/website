Since then the club has expanded to cover the whole range of athletic activities, road running, cross-country in the winter months, and track and field athletics in the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"body\"&gt;After a series of mergers with other clubs, Chiltern Harriers A.C. is now the only athletic club in the Chiltern Area, and has members from all over the region, Chesham, Amersham, the Chalfonts, Prestwood and Great Missenden. The membership stands at around 400, and is composed of athletes of all ages from 10 years old upwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"body\"&gt;The club competes in the National Youth Development League and the Southern Women's Track and Field League, and is in Division One of the Chiltern Cross Country League. Members also compete in road races over varying distances, from 5 miles, 10K, half-marathons. The London Marathon is still very popular with members, and new members join us each year to train for this event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"body\"&gt;The club stages several events throughout the year, these are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=\"0\" style=\"height: 63px; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; border-style: none;\"&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=\"height: 21px;\"&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.4766%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.5234%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"body table table-striped\"&gt;Pednor 5 Mile Road Race and Race Walk around Pednor, Chesham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=\"height: 21px;\"&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.4766%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"table table-striped\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.5234%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"body table table-striped\"&gt;Shardeloes 10K multi-Terrain Race and 4K Fun Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=\"height: 21px;\"&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.4766%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"table table-striped\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.5234%; height: 21px;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"body table table-striped\"&gt;Herbert’s Hole – 10 K Cross Country race from Chesham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We cater for athletes who enjoy the competitive aspects of the sport and thrive on competition, and also those who just want to run for pleasure and to keep fit. We organise a variety of training runs, which take us all over the Chiltern countryside. All our members benefit from belonging to a club and being able to run with people of like ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The club has several training sessions each week, the main training sessions being:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seniors&lt;/strong&gt; – Tuesdays at 7.30pm from the Chiltern Hills Academy, Chartridge Lane, Chesham HP5 2RG&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juniors&lt;/strong&gt; – Thursdays at 7.00pm at different locations throughout the year, and on Sunday mornings at Hervines Park, Amersham&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=\"h2\"&gt;Would you like to join us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=\"h3\"&gt;Senior Athletes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to just come along to our main Training Session on Tuesday night at Chiltern Hills Academy, Chartridge Lane, Chesham HP5 2RG. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our session starts at 7.30pm and is lead by one of our Club Coaches. Come a few minutes early and introduce yourself to either Trevor Davies, who organises the Tuesday session, or one of the coaches, Trevor Brawn or Steve Field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Try out a couple of sessions, and then decide if you would like to continue and join the club.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(During the summer there are some Tuesdays away from our base - just check the Event Diary where they are listed. Also sessions in September start at 7.00 pm)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=\"h3\"&gt;Junior Athletes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please see our separate page for contact details regarding Young Athletes&lt;/p&gt;",
