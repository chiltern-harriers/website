I hope you’ve had a lovely weekend of running and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Starting, in the traditional fashion, with parkrun on 6 July, there were course PBs for Ian Lawson (19.49 at Upton Court); Ade McCormack (22.29 at Enniskillen) and for Neil and I (20.35 and 21.17 at Wendover Woods). I was pleased to also come in as first lady. Meanwhile, Rashila Wanninayake and Matt Robins were king and queen of the Bank Farm RDA 5k fun run. Strava time of 36.56.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"paragraph\"&gt;At the opposite end of the scale, Ross Jarman took part in the Serpent Trail 100k, finishing in a very impressive 10thposition in a total time of 12.38.42. Well done!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And moving to today, Sunday 7th July, James Repper was first in his age category at the Hever Aquathlon (part of the Festival of Endurance at Hever) in a total time of 2.34.32. Up north, Dave Williams has been taking part in the Saunders Lakeland Mountain Marathon – a two-day mountain marathon (ie. orienteering) event in the stunning Lake District. Dave and partner Chris Ryder completed the two days  of the Carrock Fell class in a total time of 12.48.30, and came in in 19thposition (for your information, that encompasses some 34.5 miles and 11,000 ft of climb.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DON’T FORGET: Tuesday 16 July is the next Senior ‘Away Day’ (The Water Run). Meet at 1930 in Rickmansworth. £5 for the coach. No need to book. A lovely run along the Grand Union Canal.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://chilternharriers.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/1/9/26199763/20190716waterrun.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;More details here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;COMING UP LOCALLY: Hellfire Half &amp;amp; 10k, Waddesdon 5k, Burnham Beeches 10k and Half Marathon and the Bearbrook 10k.
